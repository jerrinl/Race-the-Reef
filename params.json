Simoultaneously, predators are out there looking for their next meal. Duck and dodge the vicious fishes and find refuge in one of the chemical clouds emitted by the reef. \r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThis project was created for Jason Leigh's Data Visualization course at UH Manoa, in joint with faculty of UH Hilo. The class brings together students of various disciplines to transform data from research into a valuable lesson for the public.\r\n\r\nThe setting is the Waiopae Reef, which is housed off the east coast of Hawaii island. The in game reef is an actual model shaped by the Coral Health Atlas at UH Hilo. Thanks to their research and work we are able to immerse members of the public in the reef.\r\n\r\nThis game was made in Unity3D with assets produced in Sketchfab, Maya, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Project Download\r\n\r\nProject is currently being uploaded to Github but due to a large file policy a workaround is being worked on. In the meantime, check out the files on Google Drive here:\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/a/hawaii.edu/file/d/0BwxjdSxJRy-kM3F1VzI2T3lkQ00/view\r\n\r\n## Demo Video\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=gU1_vGUaoqQ\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ioTvojH.png\" \r\nalt=\"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE\" width=\"630\" height=\"340\" border=\"10\" /></a>",
